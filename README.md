# Video Fucker

This program will let you:
1. loop a video file
2. turn it into a special WEBM 
3. makes Discord, VLC or whatever get the timecode wrong, making it appear infinitely long (or as long as one's attention span, at least).  

## Usage
Just drag your video file (only tested with MP4 files) onto the respective program file.  

Using the .py file requires you have [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) installed on your machine and set up in the System PATH.  
Using the .exe file in [Releases](https://github.com/Jordy3D/VideoFucker/releases) requires nothing, but has a weird error that shows up despite not hindering functionality.  

Both work  

So go forth  
Do weird things  
Fuck those videos
